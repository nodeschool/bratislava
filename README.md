## Installing NodeJS

For obvious reasons, having NodeJS installed on your work machine is a must. :smile:

##### Windows

Using Windows 10, however, workflow should be similar for most versions.

* download v4.2.2 from https://nodejs.org/en/ (5.1.0 has problems with npm and VS2015)
* install it regularly

Open up terminal (Windows + R -> 'cmd' -> Enter) and type `node -v`. If it works, you are good to go and you can ignore the stuff below. Otherwise, continue.

* open up **This PC**
* in that window, right click the **PC** icon located above all your hard drives and directories
* in the new window, click **Advanced system settings**
* in the newest window, click **Environment Variables...**
* find the **PATH** variable, click **edit**
* add the following: *YOUR_ABSOLUTE_NODEJS_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/;* and *C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\npm;*
* please note that all PATH variables must be separated with **;**

##### Ubuntu

* open up terminal
* `sudo apt-get install nvm`
* `nvm install 5.1`

### Install Node with nvm on any Unix(Linux, Mac...)
Node version manager (best practice): you can switch between Node version

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v5.0.0/install.sh | bash         #grab version 4
source ~/.profile       # to get system aware of nvm - include nvm in $PATH = so you can use 'nvm' command in terminal
nvm ls 			# if you get error install git
apt-get install git, dnf/yum install git ....
# install any node version you want
nvm install v5.0.0
nvm install v5.1.0
node --version   	# node you're currently using
nvm use v 5.0.0 	# changes node version only in current terminal tab
nvm alias default v5.0.0  # now this version is set as system default 
so if you do not set it expclicitely v5 is set as default but you can override it - but only in terminal tab where you type "nvm use vX.y...."
elswhere (where you do not set it  expclicitely - v5.0.0 would be used
